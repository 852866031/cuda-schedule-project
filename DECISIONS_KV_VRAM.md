# Decision log — KV slots on the decode GPU

Each entry: what was decided and why, the prediction written **before** the run, and
the outcome added after. Plan: [PLAN_KV_VRAM.md](PLAN_KV_VRAM.md).

## D0 (2026-10-25) — branch setup

- Stripped the branch to the 8B split stack (`scripts/inf_pf_prio/`), `scripts/common/`
  and the ninth study's results; 1391 tracked files removed with `git rm` (other
  branches keep them). Kept `output/calibration_pcie.json` as a prior reference.
- Verified from the archived decode logs: 23 GiB → 55,488 KV tokens (8 whole
  6400-token requests), 25 GiB → 71,872 (11).
- No MPS daemon in this study: GPU1 has one tenant.
